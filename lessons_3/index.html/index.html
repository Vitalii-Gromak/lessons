         <p>Although welcomed by Kyiv as a critical weapon to expel Russia’s invasion, the Leopard 2 tanks from Germany
            and Abrams tanks from the United States are unlikely to arrive soon.</p>

         <div class="text">With the precision of a military drill, first Germany and then the United States announced on
            Wednesday that each had agreed to provide battle tanks to help Ukraine beat back Russia’s invading forces.
            In reaching a deal, the two countries extricated themselves from a diplomatic morass that had consumed the
            attention of Western officials for weeks and exposed divisions between Ukraine’s allies.
            Ukrainian leaders, with an eye on the tough battles widely assumed to lie ahead in the spring, had urged
            Germany to send its vaunted tank, <span>Leopard 2. Berlin resisted.</span>

         <h2>The State of the War</h2>
         <div class="list">
            <ol>
               <li>Military Aid: Germany and the United States announced they would send battle tanks to Ukraine, a
                  decision that came after weeks of tense back-channel negotiations between Western officials. But it
                  may be months before the tanks rumble across the battlefield.</li>
               <li>Corruption Scandal: After a number of allegations of government corruption, several top Ukrainian
                  officials were fired, in the biggest upheaval in President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government since
                  Russia’s invasion began 11 months ago.</li>
               <li>An Expanding Cemetery: Recent satellite imagery and video footage of a growing burial ground offer a
                  rare look at combat fatalities sustained by the Wagner mercenary group during the war.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first Leopard could take months to arrive on the battlefield, and the Abrams a year or longer. The
               tanks will also number far fewer than the hundreds that Ukraine says it needs to defeat the Russians.
               But Germany’s decision to send tanks from its own stores paves the way for a dozen other European
               countries to send their own — a movement of heavy weaponry that could eventually help Ukrainian forces
               dent Russia’s advantage in troop numbers and equipment, military experts say.
               In all, Kyiv emerged from the agreement with enough tanks for about three new Ukrainian battalions. The
               United States said it would send 31 Abrams tanks, and Germany said it would send an initial shipment of
               14 Leopards.</p>
